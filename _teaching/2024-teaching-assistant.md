During my 8th undergraduate semester, I served as a teaching assistant under Prof. Priya Badrinath, for 180+ students.
[My GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashishkulkarnii/oops-java-ta) contains assignments and files I created during my stint as an undergraduate TA for the 6th-semester course _Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Java_ (UE21CS352B).
- Created lab contests to test students' understanding of Java and OOP concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, multi-threading, serialization, etc. Crafted a total of 14 detailed problem statements, generated test cases to evaluate them, and hosted them on HackerRank.
- Wrote multi-page case studies for students to create use-case models, class diagrams, activity diagrams, and Java solutions.
- Created a detailed guide on the model-view-controller architectural pattern, and wrote a case study for students to build a Java MVC solution to.
- Solved and shared solutions for every task I assigned.
