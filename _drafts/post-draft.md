I am Ashish Kulkarni, a sofware developer from Bengaluru, India. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from PES University in 2024. This website serves as a platform for me to present some of the best work I have accumulated over the past few years: projects, papers, articles, and more.

The first experience I had with research was at a startup called StanceBeam. I interned at StanceBeam for two months in 2022, between my 4th and 5th semesters. StanceBeam is a sports technology company with an ambitious mission: to disrupt the cricket decision-review systems of today with a far cheaper alternative. As a computer vision intern, I worked on spatial positioning using stereovision and epipolar geometry. The work I did during these two productive months was demoed to BCCI in Dubai. This kind of exposure, early in my career, primed the way I approach problems today.
