[This repository](https://github.com/ashishkulkarnii/blender) contains some of the Blender models I created for the course Augmented and Virtual Reality (UE20CS315).

These models were utilized, along with others, in creating a model of our college.
This model was loaded into Unity to create an interactive VR experience, which was a deliverable at the end of the course.
